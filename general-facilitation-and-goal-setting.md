## Getting in Touch with Past and Present DLF Group Leaders

Past and present coordinators of our existing groups are also a great resource, and in our experience they are always eager to share. Do you admire what an existing DLF group has accomplished? **Get in touch with us at** [**info@diglib.org**](mailto:info@diglib.org) **and we will direct you to the right person.**

> You will lose people along the way – don’t fret it. Focus on where the energy is, and keep the ball rolling by engaging the ones with the energy.
