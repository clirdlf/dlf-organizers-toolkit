## Twitter Chats

Is your project just getting started? The DLF [Digital Library Pedagogy group](https://www.diglib.org/groups/digital-library-pedagogy-working-group/) has found Twitter chats a successful way to engage current members in conversation, gauge interest in initiatives, and attract new members. DLF has also hosted chats on behalf of newly-forming groups on subjects like user requirements for born-digital resources. We are happy to hand over control of our [@CLIRDLF](https://twitter.com/CLIRDLF) Twitter account to your selected chat leaders, through Tweetdeck, for extra promotion of the event and so that questions can be tweeted out from a central account. Just [get in touch](mailto:info@diglib.org) for scheduling!

DLF groups often schedule Twitter chats in the afternoon and occasionally in the evening, in order to reach a broader group of participants across time zones and personal/professional obligations. Another common practice is to make a transcript available afterward as both a spreadsheet and a Wakelet presentation. Below are some resources on organizing, running, and documenting Twitter chats.

## Taking the Pulse

We also suggest conducting short surveys and polls, or requesting open comment on a brief, draft document or mission statement, as a good way to get a sense of your community. You can use tools like Google Forms/Google Docs or Twitter polls for this purpose, but for more in-depth, formal surveys we are happy to help you explore available options to build your survey

Please feel free to contact us for assistance or go right ahead with lighter-weight approaches! We only ask that you be sure to **tag DLF on any social platforms you’re posting on (**[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/CLIRDLF)**,** [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/CLIRDLF)**,** [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/clirdlf/)**, or** [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-library-federation)**)** and **send messages about your work to our primary listserv**, [DLF-Announce](https://diglib.org/announce), so that we can help promote it and drive traffic your way!
