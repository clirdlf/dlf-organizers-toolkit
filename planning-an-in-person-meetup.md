Many DLF groups and communities meet annually at the [DLF Forum](https://www.diglib.org/dlf-events/past/). In-person meetings can be a great way to give your group a milestone toward which to work, and DLF groups find Forum gatherings a fun way to celebrate accomplishments, generate ideas and goals, welcome new members, and build momentum for the coming year. Our staff are available to consult, advise, and help with logistics. Possibilities include panel discussions, working sessions **(where established DLF groups get special priority)**, breakfast meetings, workshops, or evening social meetups.

Some examples from recent DLF Forums:

*   [Digital Library Assessment: Brainstorming the Year Ahead](https://sched.co/15r3f)
*   [Experimenting with Immersive Pedagogy: Exploring lessons from DLF Teach Toolkit 2](https://sched.co/15r4U)
*   [DLF Working Groups at the 2020 Virtual DLF Forum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl7V7chP13lCN6PaEUKi_eUVX4mc3UTJm)
*   [Reports From the Duffle Bag: Born-Digital Access Group Working Breakfast/Lunch Session](https://sched.co/S2V2)
*   [Teaching the DLF Project Managers Toolkit](https://sched.co/FVCF)

Some things to think about if planning in-person meet-ups or events held outside of DLF Forum:

*   Where will your community be gathering anyway? Add-on events save costs!
*   What work can be done [ahead of time](/dlf-organizers-toolkit/year-round), and what benefits most from in-person exchange?
*   How can you make your meeting as [inclusive and accessible](/dlf-organizers-toolkit/diversity-inclusion) as possible?
*   What support from DLF would make all the difference?

## Your Responsibilities

DLF staff will make every effort to create a safe and welcoming environment on-site at the DLF Forum, but please don’t forget that even off-site DLF group meetings (such as happy hour events and dinners) fall under the terms of our [DLF Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/). Please take [your responsibility](/dlf-organizers-toolkit/#diversity-inclusion) as host seriously, and work to make gatherings enjoyable for everyone. To report incidents after our events, in online venues, or on-site but in the absence of a staff member, review our reporting procedures in the link above.
