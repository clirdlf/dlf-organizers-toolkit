## Discussion Lists

For very large group discussions, DLF supports listservs. Just ask us about setting one up. However, many of our groups prefer to create and manage their own Google Groups. (A tip from organizers: Google Group subscriptions default to no mail. Be sure your new subscribers adjust their settings to receive communications—or that you adjust them for them!) Finally, some DLF groups are setting up Slack spaces or channels within existing Slacks. If you do, let us know, so that we can join and help promote.

*   [CLIR/DLF listservs](https://lists.clir.org/)
*   [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!overview)
*   [Slack](https://slack.com/)

We’re also open to assisting with and promoting the use of other systems. Have an idea for a better way to communicate? [Contact us!](https://www.diglib.org/about/staff/)

## Collaborative Editing

Whether it’s a meeting agenda or set of minutes, a white paper, a blog post, or a CFP, you have many tools at your disposal for writing and editing as a group. These include: the [DLF wiki](https://wiki.diglib.org/Main_Page) (you can freely create new accounts and set up pages), Google Drive (for self-managed documents and spreadsheets), and Github (either managed independently or—for sustainability—in collaboration with CLIR/DLF).

*   [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) – many groups rely on Google docs for meeting agendas and shared notes
*   [CLIR/DLF GitHub](https://github.com/clirdlf/)
*   [Group Writing](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/group-writing/) – The Writing Center at UNC Chapel Hill
*   [Seven Ways to Use Github That Aren’t Coding](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/08/seven-ways-to-use-github-that-arent-coding) – readwrite
*   [GitHub, Academia, and Collaborative Writing](https://www.hastac.org/blogs/harrisonm/2013/10/12/github-academia-and-collaborative-writing)
*   [Help:Contents](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Contents) – MediaWiki (your entry point for using the DLF wiki)
