DLF groups are typically formed by people with good ideas, so there’s no annual timeline or formal approval process for affiliation. Ideas for new working groups develop in a variety of ways. Many groups, like our [Climate Justice Working Group](https://www.diglib.org/groups/climate-justice-working-group/), form out of conversations begun at the DLF Forum. Other groups arise as a continuation of prior work and initiatives begun outside of DLF, like the [Technology Strategy for Archives Working Group](https://www.diglib.org/groups/technology-strategy-for-archives/). Have an idea for a working group, but not sure where to begin? Simply get in touch with us at [info@diglib.org](mailto:info@diglib.org) to discuss the possibilities!

Our working group leaders are self-starters and we encourage them to think creatively about platforms they can use independently to get their work done. The DLF Team works with groups on a case-by-case basis to try to get them the [resources](/dlf-organizers-toolkit/#team-dlf) they need. We also make sure to reserve some space for DLF-affiliated groups at the DLF Forum.

In exchange, we ask that your group:

*   Operate under the DLF [Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/) if you use our name (or a similar code, in case of a partnership or pre-existing group).
*   Keep your DLF website and OSF and/or wiki pages reasonably up-to-date (even if those are mostly just pointers to information held elsewhere). See [“DLF-Specific Communications Venues”](/dlf-organizers-toolkit/#dlf-comms) for a list of platforms we currently provide for our working groups.
*   If promoting on social media, tag DLF on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CLIRDLF), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CLIRDLF), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-library-federation), or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clirdlf/), and send messages about your work to our primary listserv, [DLF-Announce](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=DLF-ANNOUNCE), so that we can help promote it and drive traffic your way!

Please don’t hesitate to [reach out to us](mailto:info@diglib.org) with any questions or ideas! Starting a new initiative or working group could be as simple as: 

*   Sending out a call for interest to gauge interest in the community;
*   Getting in touch with those willing to put in time, to schedule a meeting and develop a plan; or
*   Using DLF as a platform to circulate new ideas, resources, and readings, and to make progress on issues.
