The Digital Library Federation is purposefully [lightly staffed](https://www.diglib.org/about/staff/). This means that **we welcome your creative thinking** about the best ways to get things done—no process or system is set in stone, and you are not required to use technologies we offer or work to a certain timeline in order to get our support.

## How We Can Help

Team DLF is always available to help with:

*   Forming new groups and initiatives, and discussing needed levels of DLF support;
*   Facilitating collaborations with other DLF groups and committees, including quarterly meetings for current working group leaders, and making connections beyond the immediate DLF community;
*   Creating editable pages on the DLF [website](https://diglib.org/) and wiki, or creating and hosting other web resources;
*   Communications, including signal-boosting: promoting your group’s activities through DLF’s various social media channels, calendars, and lists;
*   Setting up an [email list](https://lists.clir.org/), scheduling a conference call (see [“Scheduling Meetings on CLIR+DLF’s Zoom Account”](/dlf-organizers-toolkit/#zoom)), or facilitating a Twitter chat;
*   Options for open access publications, both online and print, including through [CLIR](http://clir.org/);
*   Managing your data, with connections to DLF’s [Github](https://github.com/clirdlf) and [OSF](https://osf.io/qa8kc/) repositories;
*   Planning and organizing an in-person meet-up at the annual DLF Forum;
*   Creating [cross-pollinator](https://www.diglib.org/opportunities/fellowships/) opportunities to connect your conference or community to ours;
*   Providing limited financial sponsorship or in-kind contributions to good causes;
*   Brainstorming next steps for your group and consulting on ways to build and maintain momentum; and
*   Learning from each other, and answering any questions about DLF you may have!

**If you need support with any of the above or beyond, please contact us at [info@diglib.org](mailto:info@diglib.org).**

## Do I have to be a member? Does our project have to be "official?

We work with energized, committed teams regardless of the organizational affiliation of their participants. **You don’t have to be part of a DLF member organization to lead or join a working group**.

That said, everything Team DLF does depends on the financial support of our [members](https://www.diglib.org/members/). If you are in a position to influence organizational membership decisions, we’d be extremely grateful for [your advocacy](https://www.diglib.org/members/join/)!

We also happily support and amplify _far more community-based activity_ than is represented elsewhere in this Toolkit or on our [website](https://www.diglib.org/). If you’re doing great work that needs a boost but not a “home,” don’t hesitate to contact us. **We won’t co-opt or DLF-brand you**.

## Contacting DLF

We encourage you to email us at [info@diglib.org](mailto:info@diglib.org), which is a shared inbox that Team DLF accesses Monday through Friday.
